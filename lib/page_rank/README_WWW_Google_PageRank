The google_page_rank.pl program uses the WWW::Google::PageRank
module developed by Yuri Karaban to query Google's server for
the page rank.  This Perl module is available from the CPAN
archive (or any of its mirrors) at:

    http://search.cpan.org/src/YKAR/WWW-Google-PageRank-0.17/lib/WWW/Google/PageRank.pm
    
Since many potential users of this program may not have this module
installed and not wish to install such a module system-wide (or lack
the permissions to do so), a copy of version 0.17 of this module is
included in this distribution.  As long as your installation of Perl
is configured to search for modules in the current directory and you
run page_rank.pl from there, you needn't install
WWW::Google::PageRank.

The WWW::Google::PageRank module, in turn, requires the LWP::UserAgent
module and its dependencies to function; these are installed in most
modern Perl distributions.  If your system does not include them,
you'll need to track them down in CPAN and install them yourself.
